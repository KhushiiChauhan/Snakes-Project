Project: Snakes Game

Authors: Anshika Srivastava, Akash Chauhan, Khushi Chauhan

Game Overview:
The Snakes game is a timeless classic that has entertained generations. In our project, we have brought this game to life with a modern touch. Players control a snake that moves around the game board, consuming food to grow longer. The challenge lies in avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake's own body. As the snake grows, the game becomes more exciting and intense.

Tech Stack:
HTML: We used HTML to structure the game interface, including the game board, score display, and other visual elements.
CSS: Our CSS skills were put to use for styling the game, creating an engaging and visually appealing user interface.
JavaScript: The game logic was implemented using JavaScript. We handled the snake's movement, food generation, collision detection, and score tracking.

Features:
Dynamic Snake Movement: The snake's movement is smooth and dynamic, controlled by keyboard inputs.
Food Generation: Colorful food item appears randomly on the board, and the snake grows in length when it consumes them.
Collision Detection: We implemented collision detection to ensure that the snake doesn't collide with the walls or its own body.
Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score, encouraging competition and improvement.

Future Enhancements:
While our Snakes game is fully functional and entertaining, we have plans to enhance it further in the future. Some of our ideas include adding different levels of difficulty, introducing power-ups, and incorporating multiplayer capabilities to allow players to compete against each other.
Making it a responsive design to work seamlessly on different devices, ensuring an enjoyable experience for players on both desktop and mobile platforms.

Thankyou! Hope you have a wonderful gaming experience!
